# Movie-Adviser

Simple application that recommends similar movies/series

The application takes a movie or series name, a search limit (aka the number of films you want it to suggest) and a type of search, movies or series.Â 

Movie-Adviser uses tastedive API and OMDb API for this purpose, so to use it you need to create your own API keys. You can find links in the back-end file.
